# Point Map Website

Welcome to the Point Map Website repository!

This project is a web application designed to display points on a map based on input data. Users can upload their data files containing geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) along with additional information about each point.

## Features

- **Upload Data:** Users can upload CSV files containing point data to be displayed on the map.
- **Interactive Map:** The website utilizes mapping libraries to dynamically render points on an interactive map interface.
- **Customization:** Users can customize the appearance of the map and points, such as color, size, and symbol.
- **Data Visualization:** Points are visualized on the map along with additional information, allowing users to gain insights from their data.
